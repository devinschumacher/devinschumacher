# About me

Hi, I’m Devin  - Founder SERP. I'm a entrepreneur, digital marketing consultant & widely regarded as the world's best SEO & grumpy cat impersonator.

I started in internet marketing with less than zero, and have since won 4x 2CommaClub Awards & helped 1,000s of business owners & entrepreneurs grow their businesses through SEO & digital marketing in 217+ different industries/niches, generate over 200MM+ dollars of new revenue.

In since selling my agency, I’ve spent the last three years learning to code, shipping projects, and integrating AI workflows, giving me firsthand experience with developer pain points and tools. This technical fluency allows me to communicate product value in ways that resonate with both individual devs and enterprise buyers.

I’m also passionate about education: through my Udemy courses, I’ve taught 6,367 students, earning 248 reviews for my courses "Crafting The Perfect Buyer Persona (Customer Avatar)" , "Digital Marketing, Growth Hacks & Productivity Tips [Bundle]" , "Minimum Viable Programming for Maximizing AI", "Roundup Reviews (Affiliate Marketing, Blogging, SEO)", "SEO Content Writing Mastery"

Cheers & stay funky my friends!
